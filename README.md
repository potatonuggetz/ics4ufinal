This game is a tower defense game, using allied towers from *League of Legends* and enemies from *Bocchi the Rock!*. 

When an enemy reaches the end of the track, a life is lost.

In order to prevent this from happening, allied towers can be placed down in order to defeat the enemies.

Each tower has its own ability, which can be aimed by the player.

When enemies die in close proximity to towers, the towers gain XP, and eventually level up, making them stronger.
